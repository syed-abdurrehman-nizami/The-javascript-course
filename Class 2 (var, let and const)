//  In second class we can study about var, let and const.

//  var : It means that we declared a variable.       (The value of var can be chnaged)
//  let : It also means that we declared a variable.  (The value of let can be chnaged)
//  const : It means we declared a constant.          (The value of const cannot be changed)

var a = 100;
alert(a);     // It can simply show the value of a  

let b = 200;
alert(b);     // It can simply show the value of b

const c = 300;
alert(c);     // It can simply show the value of c

// NOW see that what is the difference between var , let and const.

var ab = 1000;
var ab = 2000;
alert(ab);      // It can show 2000 because var accepts the latest value of variable.

let ac = 1000;
let ac = 2000;    //   IT can give the syntax error and cannot be run
alert(ac);        //   because in let one variable cannot be declared two times.

const ad = 500;
const ad = 600;     //   IT can give the syntax error and cannot be run
alert(ad);          //   because in let one variable cannot be declared two times.

// Now see the second difference.

var x = 10;
x = 20;
alert(x);   // output is 20
               // var means variable and the value of variable can be changed easily.

let y = 20;
y = 30;
alert(y);   // output is 30
               // let means variable and the value of variable can be changed easily.

const z = 5;
z = 8;       // Error
alert(z);    // output doesn't shown
                // const means constant and the value of constant can not be changed.

let a=7;              
{                 // first it can show 8 and then it can show 7
    let a=8
    alert(a);    // if let varible can be declaredd in block means  
}                // any bracket or if , switch and loops, etc then
alert(a);        // it has a limited scope only with in it. 


// NOTE :- You should use const and let only. Mostly used const in js and
//         sometimes used let in js but not used var in js.
