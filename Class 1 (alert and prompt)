//  In our first class of javascript. We can learn that what
//  is the difference between alert and prompt?
//  alert is used to give some information to user
//  prompt is used to get some information to user.
//  Following are some examples of alert and prompt.

alert("syed abdurrehman nizami");    // It can simply show the words inside the alert.
alert('syed abdurrehman nizami');    // It gives the same result.
alert(`syed abdurrehman nizami`);    // It gives the same result.

prompt("How are you?");    // It can show the data in prompt but takes the data from user also.
prompt('How are you?');    // It gives the same result.
prompt(`How are you?`);    // It gives the same result.
